ะต# Requirements Document: Comprehensive Test Suite Fixes

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic fixing of failing tests in the Voice AI Agent project. Currently, 25 out of 438 tests are failing (5.7% failure rate), primarily due to technical issues rather than logical problems. The goal is to achieve 100% test pass rate by addressing import errors, metadata access issues, timezone handling, and other technical problems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: SQLAlchemy Import Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all SQLAlchemy-related tests to pass so that database functionality is properly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running database connection tests THEN all SQLAlchemy imports SHALL be properly resolved
2. WHEN executing migration tests THEN the `text` function SHALL be available from SQLAlchemy imports
3. WHEN running any database test THEN no `NameError: name 'text' is not defined` errors SHALL occur
4. IF a test file uses SQLAlchemy text queries THEN it SHALL import `from sqlalchemy import text`

### Requirement 2: Model Metadata Access Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want model metadata to be accessed correctly so that repository tests pass without type errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing model metadata in tests THEN the correct attribute access pattern SHALL be used
2. WHEN repository tests check model properties THEN no `'MetaData' object is not subscriptable` errors SHALL occur
3. WHEN tests access model metadata THEN they SHALL use the proper SQLAlchemy model attribute access
4. IF a test needs to access model metadata THEN it SHALL use the correct syntax for the SQLAlchemy version

### Requirement 3: DateTime and Timezone Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent datetime handling across all tests so that time-based assertions work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing datetime objects in tests THEN timezone information SHALL be handled consistently
2. WHEN testing call/conversation end times THEN timezone-aware and timezone-naive datetime objects SHALL be properly compared
3. WHEN asserting datetime equality THEN the comparison SHALL account for timezone differences
4. IF a test involves datetime comparison THEN it SHALL use timezone-aware datetime objects or proper comparison methods

### Requirement 4: Floating Point Precision Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want floating point comparisons in tests to handle precision correctly so that cost calculations pass validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing floating point values in tests THEN precision issues SHALL be handled appropriately
2. WHEN testing cost calculations THEN floating point comparisons SHALL use approximate equality
3. WHEN asserting float equality THEN the test SHALL use `pytest.approx()` or similar precision-aware comparison
4. IF a test compares calculated float values THEN it SHALL account for floating point arithmetic precision

### Requirement 5: Logging Configuration Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want logging tests to pass so that log formatting and integration work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing JSON log formatting THEN all expected fields SHALL be present in the log output
2. WHEN running logging integration tests THEN the conversation logger SHALL integrate properly with the database
3. WHEN testing log formatters THEN the `function` field SHALL be included in log records
4. IF a logging test expects specific fields THEN the formatter SHALL provide those fields

### Requirement 6: Migration System Synchronization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want migration tests to reflect the actual migration state so that database schema management is properly tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing migration status THEN the test SHALL expect the correct number of available migrations
2. WHEN running migration tests THEN they SHALL be synchronized with the actual migration files
3. WHEN testing migration execution THEN the logic SHALL match the current migration manager implementation
4. IF migration tests fail due to count mismatches THEN they SHALL be updated to reflect the current migration set

### Requirement 7: Deprecation Warning Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate deprecation warnings so that the codebase is future-proof and clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN no `datetime.utcnow()` deprecation warnings SHALL appear
2. WHEN using datetime functions THEN timezone-aware alternatives SHALL be used instead of deprecated methods
3. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL use current best practices for datetime handling
4. IF deprecated functions are used THEN they SHALL be replaced with their modern equivalents

### Requirement 8: Test Environment Stability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a stable test environment so that tests run consistently without external dependencies causing failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN external dependency warnings (like ffmpeg) SHALL not cause test failures
2. WHEN tests execute THEN tALL be isolated from system-level dependencies where possible
3. WHEN running the full test suite THEN the environment SHALL be consistent and reproducible
4. IF tests depend on external tools THEN they SHALL either mock those dependencies or skip gracefully when unavailable

### Requirement 9: Test Coverage Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain high test coverage while fixing failing tests so that code quality remains high.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing failing tests THEN existing test coverage SHALL be maintained or improved
2. WHEN modifying test code THEN the intent and scope of each test SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN tests are updated THEN they SHALL continue to validate the same functionality
4. IF test logic needs to change THEN it SHALL be documented and justified

### Requirement 10: Continuous Integration Readiness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass in CI/CD pipelines so that automated deployment and quality checks work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in CI environments THEN they SHALL pass consistently
2. WHEN the test suite executes THEN it SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
3. WHEN running tests in different environments THEN results SHALL be consistent
4. IF tests are environment-dependent THEN they SHALL be properly configured for CI/CD systems
