# Voice AI Agent

A production-ready Voice AI Agent system that enables natural voice conversations through telephone calls, integrating multiple AI services (speech-to-text, language processing, text-to-speech) with telephony infrastructure.

## Features

- üéØ **Low Latency**: Sub-1.5 second response times
- üìû **Telephony Integration**: SIP trunk support via LiveKit
- ü§ñ **AI Services**: Deepgram STT, Groq LLM, Cartesia TTS
- üîÑ **Resilient Architecture**: Circuit breakers, retries, fallbacks
- üìä **Production Ready**: Monitoring, logging, health checks
- üê≥ **Containerized**: Docker and Docker Compose support
- üß™ **Well Tested**: Comprehensive test suite with CI/CD

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd voice-ai-agent
   make setup
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   make run
   ```
