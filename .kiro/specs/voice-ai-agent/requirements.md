# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a production-ready Voice AI Agent system that enables natural voice conversations through telephone calls. The system integrates multiple AI services (speech-to-text, language processing, text-to-speech) with telephony infrastructure to create an intelligent voice assistant capable of handling incoming calls with minimal latency and high reliability.

The system is designed to be deployed in a production environment with automated development workflows, comprehensive testing, and monitoring capabilities. It must handle real-world telephony scenarios while maintaining conversation quality and system stability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a caller, I want to make a phone call to the AI agent and have a natural conversation, so that I can interact with AI services through voice without needing any special applications or technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a caller dials the configured phone number THEN the system SHALL answer the call within 3 rings
2. WHEN the caller speaks THEN the system SHALL convert speech to text with accuracy above 90%
3. WHEN the system processes the caller's input THEN it SHALL generate an appropriate response within 1.5 seconds
4. WHEN the system responds THEN it SHALL convert the response to natural-sounding speech
5. WHEN the conversation ends THEN the system SHALL properly terminate the call and log the interaction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the voice agent to maintain stable operation under production load, so that callers experience consistent service quality without interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL run continuously for minimum 8 hours without restart
2. WHEN multiple calls are received simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle each call independently without degradation
3. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
4. WHEN API services experience temporary failures THEN the system SHALL provide fallback responses to maintain conversation flow
5. WHEN system resources are monitored THEN memory and CPU usage SHALL remain within acceptable limits during operation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a fully automated development environment with comprehensive testing, so that I can deploy and maintain the system efficiently with confidence in code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is set up THEN all dependencies SHALL be installed and configured through a single command
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN automated tests SHALL run and pass before deployment
3. WHEN code is committed THEN CI/CD pipeline SHALL automatically build, test, and deploy the application
4. WHEN the system is running THEN health checks SHALL monitor all critical components and report status
5. WHEN issues are detected THEN logging SHALL provide sufficient detail for debugging and troubleshooting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want detailed conversation logs and system metrics, so that I can analyze usage patterns and system performance for optimization and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a call is processed THEN the system SHALL store complete transcription and response data
2. WHEN conversations occur THEN metadata SHALL be recorded including call duration, latency metrics, and API usage
3. WHEN system performance is measured THEN end-to-end latency SHALL not exceed 1.5 seconds for 95% of interactions
4. WHEN API costs are calculated THEN the system SHALL track token usage and associated costs for each service
5. WHEN data is stored THEN conversation logs SHALL be accessible for analysis and reporting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the system to handle sensitive data securely and maintain proper access controls, so that caller privacy is protected and system integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are configured THEN they SHALL be stored securely using environment variables
2. WHEN conversations are logged THEN sensitive information SHALL be handled according to privacy requirements
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN network access SHALL be restricted to necessary ports and protocols
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN proper credentials SHALL be validated before system access
5. WHEN data is transmitted THEN secure protocols SHALL be used for all external API communications

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want modular components with clear interfaces, so that individual services can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is architected THEN each AI service SHALL have a dedicated client with standardized interface
2. WHEN configuration changes are needed THEN settings SHALL be centralized and validated at startup
3. WHEN components communicate THEN they SHALL use dependency injection for loose coupling
4. WHEN errors occur THEN each component SHALL handle failures gracefully with appropriate fallbacks
5. WHEN the system scales THEN individual components SHALL be replaceable without system-wide changes
