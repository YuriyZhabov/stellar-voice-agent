# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the Prometheus health check failure in the Voice AI Agent monitoring system. The system currently reports "[ERROR] Prometheus health check: FAILED" which indicates that the Prometheus monitoring service is not functioning correctly, preventing proper system monitoring and alerting capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Prometheus to be properly configured and running, so that I can monitor the Voice AI Agent system health and performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN Prometheus SHALL be accessible on the configured port
2. WHEN Prometheus is queried for health status THEN it SHALL return a healthy status
3. WHEN the application metrics endpoint is scraped THEN Prometheus SHALL successfully collect metrics
4. WHEN Prometheus configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL contain valid scrape targets for all system components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Prometheus service to automatically start with the application stack, so that monitoring is always available without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker Compose stack is started THEN Prometheus container SHALL start successfully
2. WHEN Prometheus container starts THEN it SHALL wait for dependencies to be ready
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN Prometheus SHALL be included in the service orchestration
4. WHEN Prometheus fails to start THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a monitoring engineer, I want Prometheus to scrape metrics from all application components, so that I can have complete visibility into system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Prometheus scrapes the main application THEN it SHALL successfully collect application metrics
2. WHEN Prometheus scrapes the health endpoint THEN it SHALL receive valid health status data
3. WHEN Prometheus scrapes Redis THEN it SHALL collect Redis performance metrics (if Redis exporter is available)
4. WHEN scraping fails THEN Prometheus SHALL log the failure and continue with other targets

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want Prometheus configuration to be validated and corrected, so that monitoring works reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Prometheus configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL be syntactically valid YAML
2. WHEN scrape targets are defined THEN they SHALL point to accessible endpoints
3. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN Prometheus SHALL handle them gracefully
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN Prometheus SHALL reload without losing historical data
